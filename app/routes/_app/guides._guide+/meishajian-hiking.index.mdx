This is a map with key landmarks and paths related to the starting points for hiking Meishajian. The trail begins near the **Yantian Rd Station (Yántián Lù Dìtiězhàn, 盐田路地铁站)**. Moving north, the route crosses the **Shuangyong Park Overpass (Shuāngyǒng Gōngyuán, 双拥公园)**, which connects the urban area to the foothills of the mountain range. The **Beishan Ave (Běishān Dàdào, 北山大道)** runs parallel to the trail and provides easy access to the starting point, making this area a convenient place for travelers coming by metro or car to begin their hike.

## Alternate Routes

1. **Taking the Bus:**
   You can take the “Coastal Green Way” bus line (Hǎibīn Zhàndào, 海滨栈道) and transfer to the “Cloud-Sea Special Bus Line” (Yúnhǎi Zhuānxiàn, 云海专线), which stops at “The Entrance of Climbing Meishajian” (Méishājiān Dēngshānkǒu, 梅沙尖登山口). This is the easiest route, as the bus will take you up most of the mountain.

2. **Grand View of Mountain and Sea Entrance:**
   This is the shortest route to reach the top by foot. However, parking is scarce, and public transportation is unavailable. Taxis can drop you off at the “Grand View of Mountain and Sea” (Shānhǎi Dàguān, 山海大观).

3. **Tea Valley Entrance:**
   Located at the “1900 First Uprising Sculpture Park” (Gēngzǐ Shǒuyì Diāosù Yuán, 庚子首义雕塑园), this route can be accessed by the “Cloud-Sea Special Bus Line” (Yúnhǎi Zhuānxiàn, 云海专线). Parking is available at the “Tea Valley Parking Lot” (Cháxīgǔ Tíngchēchǎng, 茶溪谷停车场), or you can park near the park. You can also explore the rich history of Chinese revolutions along this route.
